## Tools and Materials

### Engines, Libraries, Frameworks, and Platforms:
-Phaser3, Typescript, Html5

We Choose to use Phaser3 framework because it is more familiar to us. 

We Choose Typescript instead of Javascript because TS is a superset of JS.

### Programming and Data Languages:
- Our project will primarily use **TypeScript** for the game logic. For styling, we will use **CSS**. JSON may be used for data storage and exchange between systems.  

### Authoring Tools:
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Our IDE for coding.  
- **Git**: Version control to manage our code and collaborate effectively.    

### Alternate Platform:
- If Phaser3 does not work well in the project, We will use Godot instead.

## Outlook
- We wish to learn the implementation of a SAVE & LOAD system for game, and the Internal and External DSLs.
