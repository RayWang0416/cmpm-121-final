## Tools and Materials

### Engines, Libraries, Frameworks, and Platforms:


### Programming and Data Languages:
Our project will primarily use **TypeScript** for the game logic. For styling, we will use **CSS**, ensuring a clean and responsive user interface. JSON may be used for data storage and exchange between systems.  

### Authoring Tools:
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Our IDE for coding.  
- **Git**: Version control to manage our code and collaborate effectively.    

### Alternate Platform:
If needed, we will explore creating a simplified standalone version of the game using **React.js** for the user interface. This alternate platform was chosen to experiment with a different UI library, offering additional flexibility and expanding our experience with modern front-end frameworks.

## Outlook
- **Unique Goals**: We aim to focus on the better game play of the resource management game, and we would like to put more effort in UI design that satisfy players.
